Data on Australian Hotel Quarantine Breaches and Overseas Cases from [covidlive.com.au](https://covidlive.com.au/breaches).  

Presented as interactive tables, timelines and a gannt chart, for easy analysis and comparison. 

**Summary**

This project offers a flexible analysis of the key outcomes from Hotel Quarantine in Australia. As facilities and methods used vary by State/Territory and also over time, it seems useful to allow interactive filtering for different time periods.

As well as interactive tables, the data is presented in timeline and gannt chart visuals, for those who prefer a visual summary.

The key metrics presented in the [covidlive.com.au](https://covidlive.com.au/breaches) tables are recalculated dynamically, reflecting your selection of a date range.  I've also added a "% Effective" calculation, for comparison to the famous "99.99% effective" claim.

"Forecast Next Breach" column is based on the date of the latest breach + the average days between breaches. Colour shading indicates how imminent the derived date is.

The data is presented using an interactive data visualisation tool: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). This allows interactive filtering of the data (e.g. by Geography or Date), and includes supporting charts and data tables.  

The dataviz is refreshed automatically, roughly every 2 hours during the daytime (AEST GMT+10).
